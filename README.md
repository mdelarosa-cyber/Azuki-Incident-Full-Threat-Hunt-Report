Date: 12/10/2025

### Platforms and Tools Used:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Advanced Hunting), Microsoft 365 Defender Portal, Kusto Query Language (KQL), MITRE ATT&CK Framework, Windows Event Telemetry (Process, Registry, Network, File, Logon), Microsoft Word / GitHub Markdown reporting

### Detected Attacker Tooling (LOLBins):

- certutil.exe, wevtutil.exe, arp.exe, attrib.exe, schtasks.exe, mstsc.exe, cmdkey.exe, net.exe

### Cloud/SaaS Channels Identified:

- discord.com (exfiltration/C2), External malicious server at 78.141.196.6

## Scenario Overview - Azuki Import/Export Incident

Azuki Import/Export Trading Co. (梓貿易株式会社) is a small shipping logistics company (23 employees) operating between Japan and Southeast Asia. The security investigation was initiated after a competitor undercut Azuki’s 6-year shipping contract by exactly 3%, and sensitive supplier contracts and pricing data were later observed on underground forums. This strongly suggested a targeted compromise with data theft motivated by competitive and financial gain.

The investigation focused on a single compromised endpoint, AZUKI-SL, an IT admin workstation, using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) telemetry as the primary evidence source. The hunt aimed to answer core incident response questions:

Initial access method – How did the attacker first get in?

Compromised accounts – Which identities were abused?

Data stolen – What information was accessed or staged?

Exfiltration method – How did the data leave the environment?

Persistence – Did the attacker maintain ongoing access?

This scenario was designed as a full end-to-end professional threat hunt, emphasizing methodology over simple “flag hunting.” The workflow followed a structured process: reviewing the investigation guide, iterating through each attack stage (initial access, discovery, defense evasion, persistence, credential access, C2, lateral movement, and exfiltration), and documenting findings, queries, IOCs, and the final timeline in a formal investigation report—mirroring real SOC investigation practices.


## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Initial access occurred via a successful RemoteInteractive login from 88.97.178.12, compromising user kenji.sato on host azuki-sl.

Discovery actions included ARP cache enumeration, indicating situational awareness and network mapping.

Multiple defense evasion techniques identified, including hidden folders, Windows Defender exclusions, and event log clearing.

Persistence mechanisms established via malicious scheduled tasks and unauthorized administrator account creation.

Credential access achieved using the Mimikatz module sekurlsa::logonpasswords.

Command-and-Control (C2) communications established using both 78.141.196.6 (HTTPS) and discord.com (cloud exfiltration channel).

Lateral movement attempts made toward internal host 10.1.0.188 using cmdkey and mstsc.exe.

## HOW – Attack Chain Overview

### 1. Initial Access → Remote login via compromised credentials
   - Identified a successful remote logon from external IP address 88.97.178.12 on 2025-11-19 at 11:55:03 UTC. This activity is assessed as the likely          point of initial access.

### 2. Discovery → Host/network enumeration via ARP
   - Leveraging prior host and account context, I queried for ARP activity to validate potential network discovery. Logs show the attacker executed ARP commands to enumerate the host’s ARP cache.

### 3. Defense Evasion → Hidden folder, Defender exclusions, log clearing
   - Analysis of DeviceProcessEvents revealed the execution of:
attrib.exe +h +s C:\ProgramData\WindowsCache.
Threat actors commonly use attrib.exe to hide directories used for data staging or persistence, indicating potential preparation for exfiltration.
   <img width="1192" height="107" alt="Defense_Evasion" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1480c6b8-32f7-4041-b1d7-25a89c4e4c48" />

   - Queried DeviceRegistryEvents for Defender file-extension exclusions and identified three malicious exclusions—.bat, .ps1, .exe—using the following KQL query.
   <img width="619" height="108" alt="Defense_Evasion2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bf3dfb-b49b-4dca-9c92-775163dbf5ec" />

   - I reviewed Windows Defender exclusion settings to identify any temporary folder paths potentially created by the attacker. The search revealed an exclusion for
C:\Users\KENJI~1.SAT\AppData\Local\Temp, created on 2025-11-19T18:49:27.6830204Z on azuki-sl. The following KQL query was used to identify this modification.

   - 
### 4. Execution → PowerShell script wupdate.ps1
   - I reviewed built-in Windows tools with network capabilities that could have been leveraged during the attack. The analysis showed that certutil.exe      was used to download a file from http://78.141.196.6:8080/svchost.exe and save it into the hidden directory C:\ProgramData\WindowsCache\svchost.exe.
   <img width="661" height="127" alt="Defenseevasion4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1285069-43c3-4793-9fd2-feb1823b13a3" />

### 5. Persistence → Scheduled task + admin account “support”
   - I reviewed DeviceProcessEvents for evidence of malicious scheduled task creation. I identified a suspicious task named “Windows Update Check” created    on 2025-11-19T19:07:46.9796512Z on azuki-sl. This task was added by the attacker to maintain persistence.
   The schtasks.exe /create command included a /tr argument pointing to the malware executable, indicating which payload was configured to run automatically.

   <img width="1283" height="107" alt="Persistence1Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a93e14fc-86d6-4e85-95e4-2e2a1f09b638" />

### 6. Credential Access → Mimikatz dump from LSASS
   - I reviewed DeviceFileEvents for executables written to the attacker’s staging directory, C:\ProgramData\WindowsCache, and specifically looked for short or abbreviated filenames commonly used to disguise malicious tools. This analysis identified mm.exe, which is associated with Mimikatz.
   <img width="668" height="134" alt="credential_access1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ea6da5-3569-4e2c-933d-6d96bd0eb5a6" />
   <img width="813" height="135" alt="credential1access" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7728bb7a-61e4-47e4-a9df-855990a36376" />
   - During process command-line analysis, I identified execution consistent with credential-dumping tools that use the module::command syntax (e.g., Mimikatz). The attacker invoked the sekurlsa::logonpasswords module, which targets LSASS to extract stored credentials, including plaintext passwords, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets.  This activity occurred on 2025-11-19T19:08:26.2804285Z.
   <img width="666" height="120" alt="memoryextractionmodule" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4923074a-518e-4752-94fc-44843db7ea65" />
   <img width="1210" height="200" alt="memory1extractionModule" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb272926-9225-4c4e-80bf-b816125ff5c0" />

### 7. C2 → HTTPS beaconing + Discord-based exfil
   - To assess potential data exfiltration activity, I followed guidance to analyze outbound HTTPS traffic and determine whether the attacker leveraged cloud storage or communication platforms commonly abused for data theft. The methodology included:

      Reviewing DeviceNetworkEvents for suspicious outbound connections

      Identifying traffic to file-sharing or messaging services

      Filtering for processes associated with the attacker’s staging directory (WindowsCache) observed earlier in the intrusion

      Based on this approach, I executed the following KQL query to inspect outbound HTTPS connections:
      <img width="959" height="165" alt="exfiltration channel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f5f31b-af04-4695-9578-d3b1626d2cd2" />
      - This query isolated outbound network activity originating from the malicious process executing out of the attacker-created WindowsCache directory, showing connections to discord.com.

### 8. Lateral Movement → Use of mstsc.exe targeting 10.1.0.188

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT
### Actual Impact

- Full compromise of local credentials

- Potential compromise of adjacent systems

- Exfiltration of staged archive (export-data.zip)

- Loss of event log telemetry due to security log clearing

## Risk Level: CRITICAL

## RECOMMENDATIONS
### IMMEDIATE

- Disable compromised accounts (kenji.sato, support)

- Isolate azuki-sl from network

- Block outbound traffic to 78.141.196.6 and discord.com

### SHORT-TERM (1–7 days)

- Reset all passwords

- Review RDP access policies

- Restore event logging configurations

### LONG-TERM

- Implement MFA for all remote access

- Enforce Defender tamper protection

- Deploy EDR with behavioral protections and script blocking

- Conduct enterprise-wide credential hygiene assessment
